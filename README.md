“Text2SpeechEditor” is an editor that provides to the user the ability to convert either a text or a line to sound, and more specifically to a male voice. At the same time, the user can handle multiple of settings which allow him to experiment with volume, pitch and speech rate. It should be mentioned that reverse mode is available, too. Another fact that could trigger the user’s interest, is the codification system which is provided by our editor. There are two types of codification, Rot13 and AtBash. Finally, the user can re-execute the actions which have been already performed, whenever he wants.
